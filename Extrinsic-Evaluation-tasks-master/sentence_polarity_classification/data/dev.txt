0	an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see .
0	the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .
0	having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all .

0	a bit of whimsically warped history elevated by the central performance of ian holm .
0	an efficient , exceedingly likable family film about orphans and sports that comes with equal doses of sentimentality , corny jokes and life lessons .
0	the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness .
0	the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace .
0	while soderbergh succeeds in recapturing the themes and mood of tarkovsky's version , he also brings with them a cold , emotionless sheen , a detached air that defeats his efforts to truly engage us .
0	a film that perfectly distills the relationship between pop music and teens searching for identity .
0	[siegal] proves that you don't have to be a just out of film school gen-x'er to make a resonant and entertaining movie about young adults .
0	ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing .
0	how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know .
0	it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
0	the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .
0	it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
0	it's incredibly enjoyable to watch derrida pick apart , and fight against , the very process and premise of making a film about someone , particularly him .
0	it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
0	it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up .

0	a merciless thriller , threateningly beautiful to look at and eerie to behold .
0	windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop .
0	less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
0	for all the realpolitik underpinnings , this is less john le carre than a tech noir " die hard " in downtown seoul .
0	a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu .
0	in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 .
0	[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
0	this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
0	watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power .
0	would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
0	the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance .
0	the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo .
0	a middlebrow hybrid that should satisfy most fans of spy movies without blowing them away .
0	mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .

0	the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
0	the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
0	we become complicit in our own seduction : we willingly let bielinsky manipulate us .
0	more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
0	i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops .
0	it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
0	enigma is anything but enigmatic about affairs of the heart , and is well worth seeing for its elective affinities alone .
0	this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .
0	" brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film .
0	beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of prejudice .
0	90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .

0	as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should .
0	lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
0	it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film .
0	[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material .
0	family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
0	[raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see .
0	elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this .
0	done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment .

0	despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
0	piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
0	it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
0	ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
0	in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
0	full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life .
0	. . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
0	[hayek] doesn't just act frida , she inhabits her .

0	ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .
0	just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
0	it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come .
0	at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary .
0	hawn lets it all hang out in this film and i have to admire her guts . sarandon is equally bold and daring in her portrayal of a woman who has lost her way in a closet full of beige suits .
0	jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging .
0	tadpole may be small , but it's something special -- a cheeky comedy knockout .

0	in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie .
0	japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .
0	it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .
0	a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood .
0	a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary .
0	with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters .
0	77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it .
0	greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior .

0	there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
0	it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
0	a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love .
0	some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .
0	as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
0	it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 .
0	a witty and suspenseful tone poem with a magnetic isabelle huppert as a perverse , central character .
0	none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ?
0	there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall .
0	it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks .
0	birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency .
0	if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness .
0	this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world .
0	i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad .
0	there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent .
0	it's a shame that pokemon 4ever's dialogue is so trite and flatly delivered because the tale itself presents serious ideas worthy of more poetic language .
0	paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
0	if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler .

0	travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
0	it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style .
0	for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression .
